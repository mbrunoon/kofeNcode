This would be my YouTube channel. Here you can found the scripts and code presented on videos.

The focus is improve Dev skills by doing day-to-day use cases of a developer.

Everything here is done by Iterations. When we have enough updates on content, I will re-record and post it again (also keeping the old material so we can see the evolution of the content)
